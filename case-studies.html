          <p>This was the 2nd relocation for a longstanding client. Red Workspace were involved from taking the initial brief to collaborating with both the client and agent on the building choice, guiding the interview process to choose their designer, providing detailed budgeting throughout the lengthy and specific design process to delivery of the fit-out and furniture package.</p>
          <p>The project involved significant structural alterations of the building to enable a new cantilevered feature staircase to connect the second and third floors. Red Workspace also delivered a high-end bespoke joinery and furniture package to complete the industrial fee space to form their London HQ.</p>

          <p>Red Workspace was approached by a US hedge fund to design a new office in Soho. We assisted in selecting the design team to collaborate with both the client and ourselves in creating a workspace that was less corporate and more flexible than their previous office.</p>
          <p>The project called for specialized finishes, such as leather wall panels, acoustic treatments, breakout areas, as well as high-end AV capabilities and carefully selected furniture pieces.</p>
